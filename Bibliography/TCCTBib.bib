abstract = {Statement Consider an instrument plate in a satellite, consisting of two layers of CFRP of 2 mm thick, and a layer of solid foam (F) of 12 mm inside which elements of the electric battery are housed in a modular way. Each plate module measures 300×80×16 mm 3 , and holds one Li-ion battery module (B) embedded on a centred slit of 140×70×6 mm 3 on one side of the foam (F); the effect of connections and auxiliary circuits are neglected. The following simplified thermal model is to be considered (the properties of the materials are given in Table 1). The battery element, in the most critical case, dissipates 1 W during a 30 minutes period, being idle for the other 60 minutes of the cycle. We only consider heat transfer by conduction to one of the short ends of the module, which is assumed to remain at 300 K (the other three sides of symmetry can be assumed). In particular: a) Solve the steady heat-conduction problem (1 W) from the battery element (B, to be considered in this point as isothermal) to the plate edge (Tb=300 K), through the two parallel paths: 1) direct path along the contact face; and 2) indirectly through the 6 mm foam and then along the other sheet of CFRP. b) Calculate the admissible thermal load of equipment to be mounted on the plate so that the plate temperature does not exceed 75 °C. c) Solve analytically the one-dimensional steady heat-conduction problem along the layer of CFRP alone (excluding battery) with 1 W uniformly distributed over the entire CFRP layer. d) Solve analytically the one-dimensional steady heat-conduction problem along the layer of CFRP alone (excluding battery), but now with energy dissipation evenly distributed only in the transverse direction of the module (80 mm). e) Solve analytically the one-dimensional steady heat-conduction problem along the combined layer of CFRP and battery (but not through the foam). f) Solve numerically the one-dimensional unsteady heat-conduction problem with the temporal variation of the energy dissipation given. g) Solve numerically the problem of two-dimensional transient conduction from the isothermal state to the steady state of 1 W dissipation at the battery element.
